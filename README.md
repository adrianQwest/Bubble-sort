# Bubble-sort
Looking at a bubble sort as it happens

This python program does a bubble sort commenting on what it does as it does it.

I highly recommend this YouTube video on sorting: [Visualization of Quick sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZRWRjq2CAg).
It includes the bubble sort. The other viedos in the series are fabulous as well.
